Emorph:
-------

This is code to predict the energy of a nanoparticle based on its
morphology as computed from the Wulff construction. The bulk energy
and that of the surfaces and edges is included.

NB: The code is written for simplicity rather than efficiency given
that most calculations are undemanding. The maximum number of 
surfaces and vertices are hard coded as parameters, but can be
readily changed by altering maxhkl (maximum number of surfaces)
and maxvertex (maximum number of vertices) at the top of the code
and recompiling.

Units:
------

As long as the vectors, bulk energy and surface energies are in 
consistent units then the final energies and distances will be
in the same implied units. Note that the option "jm2" is included
since it's quite common to have cell vectors in Angstroms, a 
bulk energy in eV and surface energies in J/m^2. If "jm2" is 
specified then the final quantities are in eV for energy and
Angstrom for length.

Install:
--------

To compile with gfortran installed:

gfortran -o emorph emorph.f90 matinv.f90

Run:
----

./emorph < input.emf

where input.emf is an input file.

Options for input (order doesn't matter):
-----------------------------------------

1) size

Format:
size
value

Use:
Scale factor for size of the particle.

Notes:
Should only be specified once. Last value will be used.

Default = 1.0

2) vectors

Format:
vectors
r1x r1y r1z
r2x r2y r2z
r3x r3y r3z

Use:
Specifies the lattice vectors for the system.

Notes:
Should only be specified once.

Default = none

3) surf

Format:
surface
h k l E

Use:
Specifies the Miller indices (hkl) for the surface and its energy, E.

Notes:
Can be specified as many times as necessary to include all surfaces.

Default = none

4) bulk

Format:
bulk
Ebulk

Use:
Specifies the bulk energy, Ebulk, for the unit cell given in "vectors".

Notes:
Should only be specified once.

Default = 0.0

5) jm2

Format:
jm2

Use:
Specifies that the surface energy is in J/m2 while the bulk energy is
in eV, and the vectors in Angstroms, which is a common scenario. 
Otherwise the energies and vectors are assumed to be in consistent
units.

Notes:
Should only be specified once.

Default = 1.0

6) edge

Format:
edge
h1 k1 l1 h2 k2 l2 E

Use:
Specifies the energy, E, for the edge between two surfaces with 
Miller indices of (h1k1l1) and (h2k2l2).

Notes:
Can be specified as many times as necessary to include all edges.
