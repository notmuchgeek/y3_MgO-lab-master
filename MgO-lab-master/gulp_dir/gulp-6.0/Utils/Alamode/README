This directory contains a script that is designed to help the user
run calculations of thermal conductivity via coupling GULP and Alamode.
Provided the initial input file is setup correctly, this script should
call GULP and Alamode several times until the calculation is complete. 

Notes:
------
1) As an example, a copy of example67 is provided that is modified to work
with this script. To run the example:

./runalamode -i example67

or in parallel on 4 processors, for example:

./runalamode -i example67 -p 4

2) It is essential that the original GULP input file contains the following option:

ala_mode pattern

3) The software package Alamode is available from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/alamode/

or

https://github.com/ttadano/alamode

4) Ideally both GULP and Alamode should be compiled in parallel as these calculations
can be expensive. It is assumed that the command to run MPI on your system is "mpirun";
if this is not the case then edit the script accordingly.

5) The executables for "gulp", "alm" and "anphon" must be visible in your path. Otherwise
you will need to edit the script to specify the executable name including the path.
