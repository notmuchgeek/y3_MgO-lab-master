  subroutine endstring(string,length_string,end_string)
!
!  Finds the end of a string by search backwards for a non-space.
!  This is done because spaces can appear in file names.
!
!  On input:
!
!  string        = character string
!  length_string = integer length of string
!
!  On exit:
!
!  end_string    = integer first blank position in string after all non-blank characters
!
!   6/12 Created
!   8/12 Logic of search loop corrected to use end_string instead of length_string
