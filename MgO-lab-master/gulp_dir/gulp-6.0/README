Distribution for GULP 6.0 :
===========================

The following is a guide to the directories that should be present in this distribution :

Docs        : documentation and information relating to the program
Examples    : example input files for the program
Libraries   : library files for the program
Src         : source code and files relating to the installation of the program
Utils       : utility routines associated with GULP

To install GULP on most Unix/Linux machines :

(1) Go to Src/
(2) Type "./mkgulp"
    NB: There are several flags that can be added depending on what options are
        required. The main options are:
        -h => print help text to list the options below
        -m => parallel compilation with MPI
        -d => compile with debug options
        -f => compile with FFTW3 for Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald
        -k => compile with OpenKIM (needs version 2.0)
        -p => compile with Plumed plug-in
        -c ARG => change the compiler to "ARG". gfortran (default) and intel are supported.
        -j ARG => specify the number of cores to be used for task (i.e. make -j)

        -t ARG => change the task to ARG. gulp (default), clean, lib, tar, fox-clean
(3) If the above fails - edit "mkgulp" and correct the settings for your machine
    NB: Look for the string "USER" for places where you may need to edit things that
        are specific to your machine. Usually the libraries are in a different location
        or not installed if compilation fails.
(4) Set the following environment variables to indicate where the program files can
    be found:

    GULP_LIB    The location of the Libraries directory
    GULP_DOC    The location of the Doc directory
    ALAMODE_DIR The main directory for the alamode code for thermal conductivity calculations
                NB: The current version works with either Alamode version 0.9.8, 1.0.2 or 1.1.0

Compiler notes:
---------------
1) gfortran: Compilation requires version 4.6 or more recent 
             NB: If using gfortran v10 it compilation in serial should be fine. If you want to 
                 compile in parallel then you need to make sure that "-fallow-argument-mismatch" 
                 is added to mpif90/mpicc in mkgulp.
2) Intel: Some old versions may fail to compile, but the following have been tested and verified to work:
   2019.3.199
   2018.1.163
   2017.4.056
   17.0.0.098
   16.0.1.150
   15.0.0.090
